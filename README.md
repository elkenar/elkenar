## Programming

I learnt several languages during my apprenticeship: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, PHP, Java, C++.
I don't use most of these languages any more, but in some projects I do have to use : HTML CSS Javascript Python and C++ but it's rare.
Most of the tools I develop myself I make in rust because it's a very promising and memory-safe language.
I'm also trying to learn assembler to improve my reverse engineering skills.
